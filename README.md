## Initial Commit

This is a simple RAG chatbot that I have plans at some point in the future to
upgrade. For now, we use PgVector as our vector store, langchain for the utility
in setting up the db, and hugging face for models. We also use Gradio to deploy
the app.

#### Future additions
At some point in the future, I would like to add the following:
- [ ] reranking rag output
- [ ] Possibly using an agent (But perhaps not)
- [ ] implementing a semantic search
- [ ] Hosting as an API

etc
